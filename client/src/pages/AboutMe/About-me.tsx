        <article>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of postgraduate studies at Bia≈Çystok University of
            Technology in JavaScript Developer specialization. I completed a
            three-month internship as a Fullstack Developer, during which I
            collaborated with a team using technologies such as Node.js,
            Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, React, Redux or Storybook. The
            entire internship was conducted in English and based on Agile
            methodology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I have experience as a programming teacher for
            children and teenagers, where I conducted Python programming
            classes. My passion is learn new programming skills and sharing
            knowledge with others.
